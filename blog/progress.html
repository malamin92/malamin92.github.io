       <h3>The RAILS Framework</h3>
		<p>
		Hello and happy new year! I recently got hired as a full time web developer! So naturally, I
		have been pretty busy for the last couple of weeks. Not with work, I start that in a couple of
		weeks but just with little things I want to get done before I start. Of course the coding has
		not stopped and I am glad to be back writing a blog to inform you as to what I have been learning!
		As you can probable tell from my title, lately I have been fascinated by RAILS, a framework that
		is built around the Ruby language. I have been practicing and building Ruby programs for a bit so
		naturally I wanted to progress to Ruby on Rails and utilize it as a website building tool.	
		</p>	  
      
	   <h3>What is Ruby on Rails?</h3>
        <p>
		To put in simple terms, Ruby on Rails is basically a tool that is a collection of different aspects
		of Ruby as well as some uniqe parts combined together to make building websites more convinent. It
		is one of many other tools people can use to make website but Rails is certainly one of the more
		popular tools out there today. Why is it so popular? Well, mostly because it makes building website
		pretty simple once you get the hang of things. The Ruby on Rails community is a 'convention over 
		configuration' kind of community. In other words, the Ruby on Rails (I will refer to it as Rails
		going forward) community has it set of standards and guides to doing things, and it is preferable
	  	that everyone who is part of the community lerans these conventions for the sake of uniformity. So
		that is exactly what I have been upto for the last month or so. Reading lots of documentation and
		attending Rails meetups has been pretty fun as it a community of kind people willing to help each
		other out whenever possible.	
        </p>
	   
		<h3>MVC</h3>		
    	 <p>
		 So the driving force behind Rails is MVC, standing for Models, Views and Controllers. These are the
		 three aspects of a Rails application. You will probably run across these terms in some form or 
		 another over your development journey, so it is a good idea to understand these terms for the
		 most part.	
		 </p>

		 <h5>Model</h5>

		 <p>
		 A model is basically a blueprint for some data model. For example, say you are making a todo list
		 application, you will need to think of what the list will consist of. We will say the the list
		 is made of different items, and each item will have a completed boolian. We can simply make
		 an Item model and have it hold text for the item name and a boolian for the completed indication. 
		 There you have it, you have a blueprint for every item that will be on your to do list, and you
		 can basically create, read, update or delete each item via the controller which I will explain
		 next.
		 </p>
