       <h3>The RAILS Framework</h3>
		<p>
		Hello and happy new year! I recently got hired as a full time web developer! So naturally, I
		have been pretty busy for the last couple of weeks. Not with work, I start that in a couple of
		weeks but just with little things I want to get done before I start. Of course the coding has
		not stopped and I am glad to be back writing a blog to inform you as to what I have been learning!
		As you can probable tell from my title, lately I have been fascinated by RAILS, a framework that
		is built around the Ruby language. I have been practicing and building Ruby programs for a bit so
		naturally I wanted to progress to Ruby on Rails and utilize it as a website building tool.	
		</p>	  
      
	   <h3>What is Ruby on Rails?</h3>
        <p>
		To put in simple terms, Ruby on Rails is basically a tool that is a collection of different aspects
		of Ruby as well as some unique parts combined together to make building websites more convenient. It
		is one of many other tools people can use to make website but Rails is certainly one of the more
		popular tools out there today. Why is it so popular? Well, mostly because it makes building website
		pretty simple once you get the hang of things. The Ruby on Rails community is a 'convention over 
		configuration' kind of community. In other words, the Ruby on Rails (I will refer to it as Rails
		going forward) community has it set of standards and guides to doing things, and it is preferable
	  	that everyone who is part of the community learns these conventions for the sake of uniformity. So
		that is exactly what I have been up to for the last month or so. Reading lots of documentation and
		attending Rails meetups has been pretty fun as it a community of kind people willing to help each
		other out whenever possible.	
        </p>
	   
		<h4>MVC</h4>		
    	 <p>
		 So the driving force behind Rails is MVC, standing for Models, Views and Controllers. These are the
		 three aspects of a Rails application. You will probably run across these terms in some form or 
		 another over your development journey, so it is a good idea to understand these terms for the
		 most part.
		 </p>

		 <h4>Model</h4>

		 <p>
		 A model is basically a blueprint for some data model. For example, say you are making a todo list
		 application, you will need to think of what the list will consist of. We will say the list
		 is made of different items, and each item will have a completed boolean. We can simply make
		 an Item model and have it hold text for the item name and a boolean for the completed indication. 
		 There you have it, you have a blueprint for every item that will be on your to do list, and you
		 can basically create, read, update or delete each item via the controller which I will explain
		 next.
		 </p>

		 <h4>Controller</h4>
		 <p>
		 So you've got this model for the items, but how do you manipulate the items themselves? Never fear,
		 we have these handy controllers in Rails. The basic of controllers are exactly what the name
		 implies, they control what you do with the models. For example, say you want to add an item
		 to you list, simple, you just make a create method in your controller and tell it to create
		 a new Item, pretty cool right? Well, what if you want to delete or modify that item? You guessed
		 it, implement the delete and update methods in your Items controller, tell it to first find the
		 item you are looking for and then simply change it to your linking! Magic! (The rails community
		 is infamous for its 'magic'). There you go, you now know how models and controllers work, not 
		 so bad, right? Next is the best part, visuals, aka views!
		 </p>

		 <h4>View</h4>
		 <p>
		 So far, you've modeled your items for your to do list and you've learned about controllers to 
		 manipulate them, but how the heck do you actually see that stuff in the browser? Views! Views
		 are the visual aspect that the user sees when interacting with your program in the browser. 
		 Remember those neat controller methods your wrote earlier? Each of those methods have a 
		 corresponding view with it, that view will be displayed to the browser each time a method
		 is complete. Amazing! Each view is a html.erb file meaning not only can you design the
		 HTML parts of the view, but you can also put Ruby in the views so you can push out those
		 instance variables you just created for you todo list. So that create method we talked about
		 earlier will probably be a form a user can use in the browser to create items, and then we can
		 display the to do list by writing an 'index' method that we write in the controller.
		 </p>

		 <h4>That's the Magic!</h4>
		 <p>
		 So there you have it, the brilliant magic of Rails. Now you have high level knowledge of how
		 Rails works. If you want to learn more about rails and its awesomeness, I suggest you read
		 through The Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl. It's a great way to get your feet wet in rails
		 and get the train rolling. 

		 As always, practice practice practice! Happy coding!
