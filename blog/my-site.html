      <h3>My Experience Designing a Personal Site</h3>
      <h5>Dec 18, 2015</h5>

      <div class="blog-text">
        <h3>What was it like designing this site?</h3>
        <p>
          I have designed this site from scratch. It initially just started as a simple site with a blogging
          section. However, over time I have added more pieces such as the about me page, projects pages and
          a contact page. It was great building those things over time, mostly because I coded it from
          scratch. It served a learning experience. I like the fact that I customized each aspect myself
          from the wireframe up, allowing me to creatively express myself and make something that reflects me.
          I hope as a visitor of this site, people will recognize that it is unique, simple and minimal. This is the
          vision I had for my site to begin with. I did not use any frameworks such as Jekyll or Bootstrap 
          to customize my site because I am quite happy with the way it looks and I personally think that 
          using one of those frameworks does not really make my site unique. Perhaps in the future I will change
          the theme and go with a more "professional" looking site, but for now I am happy with the way it looks,
          responds and serves its purpose.
