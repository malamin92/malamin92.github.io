      <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
      <h3>Object for your Ruby World</h3>
      <h5>Nov 27, 2015</h5>

      <div class="blog-text">
        <h3>Objects in Ruby</h3>
        <p>
          You've probably heard somewhere before that everything in Ruby is an object. This is is indeed true. 
          Anytime you create a variable type in Ruby, it is in fact an object of some class. If you want to see
          what class an object you're working with belongs to, simply try the <code>#class</code> method. It will
          return to you the class of the object you called the method on, for example <code>"string".class</code>
          will return <code>String</code> and <code>5.class</code> will return <code>Fixnum</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>What is a class?</h3>
        <p>
          A Class is pretty much a blueprint for the objects you create in Ruby. It will hold instance variables
          and instance methods that are unique to that class. You see, when you create and object, you "instantiate"
          it. In other word, the object you created will be unique, that instance of the class will only hold data
          that you assign to only that instance. This is where the instance variables come into play, they will
          hold data unique to that instance of your class, and the instance methods are the methods you can call
          on those variables. This may sound a little confusing in theory, but it makes a lot of sense. In object 
          oriented laguages such as Ruby, you can use Classes to emulate real life objects. But, enough of theory, 
          let's see a class in action.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>
          <pre>
            class Fridge 
              def initialize(food)
                @food = food 
              end 

              def change_food(new_food)
                @food = new_food
              end
            end
          </pre>
          </code>
        </p>
       </div>

    <p>
      In the above code, I've created a new class called Fridge. It has an initialize method, which runs right when
      the object is created. In my case, I've decided to initalize my class by setting an instance variable <code>@food</code>,
      an instance variable is distinguished by the @ sign. So now I can create a new instance of fridge <code>my_fridge = Fridge.new('chicken')</code>. I've assigned a food to the @food instance variable with my initialize method. Now this instance
      variable will hold the food variable I assigned until I call the instance method #change_food. This can be done like:
      <code>my_fridge.change_food('potato')</code>, now the instance variable changed its value to 'potato'.

      <h3>Here comes the cool part:</h3>

      I can create a second instance of Fridge, <code>my_other_fridge = Fridge.new('apple')</code>. This new instance will
      hold its own unique instance variable @food which is now set to 'apple'. This leaves the other Fridge object
      completely untouched, meaning I can create as much Fridge's as my heart desires, just like in real life where you can
      have many fridges that have different foods, but the fridges all work the same way!
     </p>
      
      <h3>Go make some Classes!</h3>
     <p>
       I really hope this gave you a basic idea of what classes are. Of course the above was a very small example 
       of what the powers of classes are. If you want to get more used to them, I say you practice by writing some
       classes and get instantiating! Happy coding!
