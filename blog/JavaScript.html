      <h1>Iteration</h1>
      <h3>Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript</h3>
      <h5>December 5, 2015</h5>

      <div class="blog-text">
       <h3>Iteration</h3>
       <p>
         Iteration is repeating the same task on a set of data one at a time. It involves finding
         each element in a an array or hash and performing an operation, in series. Both Ruby and 
         JavaScript have ways in which you can iterate over data. Though the syntax is different for
         each, the idea is the same.  
       </p>

       <h3>Ruby Iteration</h3>
       <p>
         In Ruby, there are various way you can iterate over data, I will give a couple of common
         examples. One way it to use a built in Ruby method, there are many but I will demonstrate
         the each method, which is very common:
        <code>
<pre>
  array = [1,2,3,4,5]
  array.each do |item|
    item += 1
  end

  result -> [2,3,4,5,6]
</pre>
        </code>
        As you can see, we are going through each element of the array, and adding 1 to it. This
        is a very simple Ruby method that automates iteration. If we wanted to take a manual approach,
        Ruby allows for that as well via the while loop:

        <code>
<pre>
  array = [1,2,3,4,5]
  index = 0
  while index < array.length do
    array[index] += 1
    index += 1
  end
  
  result -> [2,3,4,5,6]
</pre>
        </code>
        The code above does the same thing as the previous example, except we are setting where the 
        index starts and how the iterator changes each time, aka which elements we are accessing 
        each time. This is great when you want more control over which elements you want to access,
        for example we could have done <code>index += 2</code> and the while loop would have skipped 
        every other element.
       </p>

       <h3>JavaScript Iteration</h3>
       <p>
         JavaScript has similar way of iteration as Ruby. I will demonstrate two common methods
         for JavaScript as well, this first of which is an automated method like the .each in Ruby.
         In JavaScript we can use .forEach:
         <code>
<pre>
 array = [1,2,3,4,5]
 array.forEach(function(entry){
    entry += 1;
 });
  
 result -> [2,3,4,5,6]
</pre>
         </code>
          Similar to Ruby, this .forEach method "automagically" iterates through each element of the
          array and performs the operations in the function passed to it. Also similarly to Ruby, JavaScript
          has a while loop as well:
          <code>
<pre>
  array = [1,2,3,4,5]
  index = 0
  while(index < array.length){
    array[index] += 1;
    index++;
  }

  result -> [2,3,4,5,6]
</pre>
          </code>
          The JavaScript while loop is almost exactly the same as the Ruby while loop as you can
          see. The <code>index++</code> is just a neat shortcut JavaScript has for adding 1 to anything,
          just add ++ to the end of any number variable.
       </p>
          <h3>Final Remarks</h3>
          <p>
            I hope the exmples I've provided helps you understand iteration a little better. I hope you
            can take away the idea of iteration and also see that both JavaScript and Ruby has similar
            ways of iterating. In my demonstration of course, I couldn't cover everything so it is left
            to you to go explore more of the vast options left in iteration in both Ruby and JavaScript.
            One that I will suggest you look at immediately is the more custom for loop in JavaScript.
            I also didn't talk about iterating over hashes, because the idea is the same as is with arrays. 
            So go explore and learn! Happy coding!
