			<h1>The CSS Box Model</h1>
			<h3>Padding, Border and Margin</h3>
			<h5>11/04/2015</h5>

			<div class="blog-text">
				<p>The CSS box model is a very interesting feature of CSS. Essenetially what the Box Model is refers to the invisible box that surounds every HTML
				element there is. It referes to the padding, border and margin that surrounds the main 'content' that resides in an element. This is a really
				neat part of HTML and CSS because what it does is allow a designer to maniputlate the spacing between elements to the tee. Each of the three
				properties of the box model allows for adjustment of the spacing of the content within the HTML body. It determines how the content will ultimately sit
				on that page in relation to the other elements that surround it. I think the best way to get a sense of the box model is to see the visual:  </p>

				<div class="box-model">
				<img src="imgs/box-model.gif" alt="Box Model" class="box-model-visual">
				<figcaption>The Box-Model</figcaption>
				</div>

				<p>As you can see from the image above, the 'content' of an element sits in the middle of the element. Then going from the inside out, there is the
				padding -> border -> margin. When trying to remember which spacing each refers to, I try to think of them in that order.</p>

				<p>Padding refers to the space that comes right after the content, between the border and the content. In order to demonstrate, I am going
				to create a div with an embeded p element "SAMPLE CONTENT", and create space between the content and green border. </p>

				<div class="pad"> <p>SAMPLE CONTENT</p> </div>

				As you can see there is space to the top, bottom and left of the content because I padded the space. Here is the the same content with no padding:

				<div class="no-pad"> <p>SAMPLE CONTENT</p> </div>

				<p>The spacing between the 'SAMPLE CONTENT' text and border is gone.</p>

				<p>At this point, the border property should be self-explanitory. It is simply the border that surrounds the content in repsect to the margin. The
				borders width can be adjusted to make it as thick as we want; the style and color can also be changed. Here is the first example but with a thicker
				border: </p>

				<div class="thick-border"> <p>SAMPLE CONTENT</p> </div>

				<p>As you can see, the padding remained the same but the border changed in thickness.</p>

				<p>The last part of the Box-Model I wil talk about is the margin. The margin is the space between the borders of two elements. When thinking about 
				elements that have no borders, I just imagine there is an invisible border because that is what the Box-Model implies, that every element has a box around it. I will demonstrate the margin between two elements with green borders as I think it will be best with visualization: </p>


				<div class="margin-one"> <p>SAMPLE CONTENT</p> </div>

				<div class="margin-two"> <p>SAMPLE CONTENT</p> </div>

				<p>Here is the same elements with closer margins:</p>

				<div class="margin-three"> <p>SAMPLE CONTENT</p> </div>

				<div class="margin-four"> <p>SAMPLE CONTENT</p> </div>

				<p>As you can see, in both cases the space between the borders of the elements changed but the padding and border remained the same.</p>

				<p>That is basic difference between the properties of the Box Model. You can alter the padding, boder and margin of elements in order to
				space out elements on your page in any way desireable. I hope you can use this knowledge next time you are trying to space the elemets on your page. This can be a confusing idea at first but you will get the hang of if you just play
				around with the properties a bit.</p>

				<p>Happy coding!</p>
