      <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
      <h3>Ruby Containers</h3>
      <h5>November 13, 2015</h5>

      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          In Ruby, two common ways to store information about a certain set of data are Arrays and Hashes. These <br>
          are both indexed collections of data, meaning that when you want to pull a certain piece of information <br>
          from the colections, you can refer to the data using the 'index' of the array or hash. The index is the <br>
          'key', and the data that lies at that certain index is the 'value', creating a key and value pair for each <br>
          piece of data. However, the way indexes of each system works are different. Therefore, when using each, <br>
          one should think about the purpose of the data and how they will use it. Since we are talking about two <br>
          systems that do similar things, I will talk about them separately.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          Arrays are one of the most common data structures used all accross the programming spectrum. As I explained <br>
          before, it uses a key and value system to store information and retrieve it. You can create an empty array in <br>
          Ruby using: <code> array_name = [] </code>, the brackets <code>'[]'</code> indicate that the variable is of the 
          Array class, and is an array. <br>At this point you can store things in the array like this: <code> array_ name << 
          'sample data' </code>, in this case I am storing a <br> string. The cool thing about arrays is that you can store 
          any kind of data that you desire at any index. This <br> means that you can store a String object type in one index 
          and a integer from Fixnum in another if you so <br> desire, making arrays very flexible and powerful. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that we know how to create an empty array, let's talk about creating an array that already has data <br> that 
          is stored initially. To do this, you simply have to put the data you want to store in the array between <br>the brackets 
          like this: <code>number_array = [1,2,3,4,5]</code>, note how each number is separated by a comma, this indicates<br>that 
          they are separate pieces of data. The created array will hold the data indicated in the variable declaration.
        </p>

        <p>
          So now we know how to create an empty array, and a full one, but how do we actually refer to the data we are storing? <br>
          In order to do this, let me show how a visual: <br> <br> <img src="imgs/array_index.gif" alt="Array Index"> <br> <br>
          This diagram shows how array indexing works. Think of each index in the array as a cell that holds the data. The indexes 
          <br>all have a unique number that starts from 0 as the first index and ends at the size of the array - 1. This means <br>
          that if I have an array with 5 pieces of data, the first index would be 0 and the last index would be 4. <strong>This is 
          very <br> important to remember in arrays. </strong> It easy to confuse the first element as being at index 1 and not 0,
          so keep that in mind <br>whenever you work with arrays. Consequently, the last of index of the array is the size of the 
          array - 1. <br>Now that you see how the index works, it is easy to retrieve a peice of data at a certain index. To do <br>
          this, use the name of the array, and the index which you want to retrieve. For example if I had an array with 5 <br>
          elements like: <code>array = [one, two, three, four, five]</code>, to get the first element, use: <code>array[0]</code>, 
          second element, use: <code>array[1]</code> <br>and so on. Using <code>array[0]</code> will return the value 'one', using
          <code>array[1]</code> will return 'two', and the rest respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those are all the basics of arrays in ruby. In my opinion, the important thing to remember is to use the correct <br>
          index when referring to an element. <strong> Always remember that the index starts at 0 and ends at the size of the 
          array - 1.</strong> <br>Also, due their ordered nature, arrays are very easy to 'iterate', or go over each index, using 
          a for loop or while loop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though hashes in Ruby work in a very similar to arrays, they are slightly different and unique in their own way. <br>Similar
          to an array, hashes also have a 'key' and a 'value'. The following declares an empty hash in Ruby: <code> hash = {}</code>, <br>
          an alternative is <code>hash = Hash.new</code>, they both do the same thing, create a new, empty hash called hash. However, <br>
          unlike arrays, in order to store something in a hash, you must always indicate the 'key' at which you are <br>
          storing the data. This is because hashes are not automatically indexed in order like arrays are. Due to their <br>
          unique, fast and immutable nature, it is best practice to use Ruby symbols as keys when working with hashes, <br>
          but Ruby allows you to use any type of object as a key. This: <code>hash[:example_key] = "example_value"</code> <br>
          will create a new hash value 'example_value' at the key ':example_key'. Note how just like arrays, you use <br>
          brackets, '[]', to indicate the key. Also note that you can create a hash with a default value that will <br>
          automatically assign a default value to any key created without a value like: <code>hash = Hash.new("default_value")</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Retrieval of hash data works just a tad bit differently than arrays, but just slightly. Let's see another diagram: <br><br>
          <img src="imgs/hash.png" alt="Hash Diagram"> <br><br>
          As you can see, all hashes have a key and a value as we discussed. So, folliwng the diagram, in order to retrieve <br>
          the data stored at key 'a', use: <code>dict['a']</code>, this will return the value 'alpha'. The same goes for the rest of <br>
          the data. Unlike arrays, it is much easier to make sense of the data at each key, because the key and value are paired <br>
          accordingly. Imagine something like a dictionary, you can just store the definitions of a word at a key and <br>
          easily retrieve that definition by using the key, a task much harder using an array. That is the basic gist of hashes <br>
          in Ruby.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this blog post was to explain the basic difference between arrays and hashes in Ruby. I hope after <br>
          reading the post, you gained some new knowledge that you can use to further your knowledge of Ruby. The best way to <br>
          understand these concepts is to practice, so go ahead and open up IRB and play around with arrays and hashes! If you <br>
          enjoyed the blog, please keep following. Until next time, happy coding!
