        In the programming world, version control is a life saver. It is a way of keeping track of every change that has been made at different stages of your programs life cycle. It can serve as a fall back if you've made a horrible mistake in your code and need to track back to a point when your program was functional and made sense. When working in teams, it is great way to stay on top of the contributions everyone is making and what parts of the code those contributions alter. It can be compared to checkpoints in a video game, if you make a mistake, you can just go back to the checkpoint instead having to start all over. This is really useful, it can be especially useful when someone is new to programming and are prone to making more mistakes.

        What git does is keep track of your changes in the code you've written. These are points in your code where you have made a <b>commit</b>, in other words take a snapshot of the current state of your code. Anytime you make a <b>commit</b>, it is logged in the gits history via a <b>HEAD^</b>. Basically, the <b>HEAD^</b> can be used along with a number to refer to a certain <b>HEAD</b>, aka the point you want to go back to. This is neat because it means tracking back to any point in your gits histroy is extremely simple.

        GitHub is great for all your git storing needs. Using GitHub you can create a <b>repository</b> for each of your projects. Whenever you desire, you can <b>push</b> the commits you've made to that repo. GitHub also allows for others to see your repositories and clone them which allows them to work on your code. If someone feels like they've made a good contribution, they can send you a <b>pull request</b> which is a request for you to <b>merge</b> their contribution to your project. If you chose to accept their pull request, those additions will be made to your repository. GitHub is great active programming community and a great way to get out and contribute to open source projects.
