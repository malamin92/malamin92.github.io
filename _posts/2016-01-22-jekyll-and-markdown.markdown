### Moving to Jekyll
I've decided to migrate my blog to Jekyll to try something new and refreshing. I also think it will be better
to have a more responsive website in the long run, along with the cool and sleek look of Jekyll layouts. 
So this site will be under construction for a bit as I migrate my old blogs over to my new Jekyll setup.
One of the biggest advantages to using Jekyll to write blogs is that is allows one to write blogs using
markdown. This is way more convenient than having to hard code things in HTML when writing a blog. In this
blog I will discuss the cool shortcuts Jekyll provides to do write blogs.

### Markdown Basics
Markdown has some neat syntax that allows you to create headers and code syntax on the fly. Here is how
you create headers in Markdown:

    # = Biggest header    
    ##### = Smallest header

This is much more convenient than having an opening and closing header tag like I used to before, making
it much easier to write blogs.
