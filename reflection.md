####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

	I already had a pretty solid foundation on padding, borders and margin, this challange just solidified
	those foundations. I use margin when I need space between elements. I use border when I need to set a visible
	border around the element I am working with. I use padding to create space between my content and the border. 
	I feel like these three elements of CSS I see a lot, anytime I see CSS. I guess that makes them some fundemental
	CSS properties and ones that I am glad to have gotten practice with in this challange. 

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?

	Positioning is pretty tricky to me. For the most part I tend to leave it alone. So I guess that means that static
	is what I use the most because it is default by CSS. I know fixed is to keep things glued to one part of the screen
	regardless of scrolling and or down the page. Relative is in the name, positioning is determined relative to an
	elements normal positioning. Lastly, absolute positioning is when an elements position is determined by its closes
	ancestor. When elements are overlapping, you can use the z-index to determine which one will be on top of which. I
	am still figuring out positioning but I know I'll get better with practice.


####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

	For the most part, I didn't find any of the styling to be very difficult. The only thing I had a little trouble with
	was getting my elements to sit on the same line but quickly discovered that it was done by using the 'inline-block' 
	display property. Other than that, my wireframe and design was pretty straight forward. I also created my nav-bar by
	desplaying my list items as inline-block elements, I also had to google. this. The easiest was definetly centering elements
	and doing the footer since its all the way at the bottom of the page and I didn't have to worry about disrupting
	other elements.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

	CSS is great for adding and formatting elements. My HTML outline went from a bland black and white 80's site
	to a decently modern looking site. I know I could spice it up even more when we learn JavaScript in a couple of weeks.
	I learned that if HTML is the bones of a website, then CSS is definelty the skin and the exterrior. They need each
	other to make a site look good and to a designers desire. I also learned CSS can be tricky sometimes and that the
	way elements behave is not always what one expects.
