			<h3> Who am I?</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Mohammad Amin. I am 23 years old and I am an aspiring web developer. I love to code.
				I think that as a programmer, only the imagination is the limit. There are so many amazing things
				that can be done on the web. I love how the world is at your finger tips and if you provide the
				right content, you can literally reach the world. This is what drives me, learning to build 
				things that will reach many people and impact their lives in a postive way, in the most efficient
				and cleanest way possible.

			<h3>Where am I from?</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, I live in the the borough of Queens, in New York. I arrived here when I was the age of 7 from a 
				small country in the east known as Bangladesh. I grew up in Queens and I love it here. Living so close to 
				New York City, I've experienced so much in terms of diversity and culture. This place is truly a melting-pot
				of anything you can think of. I've experienced so many different kinds of people and different 
				colors that make up cultures and ultimately society. Living and budding here in this fascinating, fast-paced, 
				city has helped shaped my character and mentality and is a big part of the person I am today.

			<h3>What do I do?</h3>
			<p>
				I have an undying love for technology. I always try to keep up to date with the newest technologies,
				wether it's the newest phone, hottest framework or language, I love researching how 
				new technologies build from others and how they improve, it sincerely amazes me and I dream to one day
				be one of those people who contributes to this field. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The world in general fascinates me. I have many interests and hobbies. One thing that I really love is music. I
				love arts in general but I absolutely love music. I play the guitar in my spare time, I think it is a
				brilliant instrument and it's amazing how I can still learn many things about it every time I play even
				though I have been playing it for about 8 years. Other than music, I love sports as well; I follow
				the English Premier League on a regular basis. I also love watching other sports such as basketball,
				football and baseball, always waiting for my New York teams to bring home another championship.

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>
				I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science at Hunter College in NYC. During my studies, I learned many 
				important aspects of different computer systems. I took courses in computer architecture, software design 
				involving data structures and algorithms, computer theory, operating systems and many more topics. During my
				last semester of college, I worked on a project in the Ruby on Rails framework and right then and there I knew
				web development is what I wanted to do for my career. Since I have graduated I have been teaching myself the
				different aspets of the RAILS framework and furthering my knowledge of programming in general. I am currently 
				attending Dev Bootcamp in NYC to complete their course in full-stack web development.
