How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

	It was pretty fun working on a wireframe with a pair. It was nice to a different perspective and approach.
	We shared suggestions and though we may have different taste, the layouts of the blogs were essentially the
	same. The HTML ws pretty straigh-forward since there was no styling involved, we just focused on the semantic.
	We just talked through the whole process and it was done very smoothly.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes, having a wireframe was extremely helpful. It was like having something to look at to figure out what to
	do next in my code. Having the whole picture was great and coding it was just putting all the pieces together
	of the big puzzel and once done, it felt great. Having a wireframe is also helpful because you don't have to
	imagine anything while you're coding, it's all there for you to reference if you get stuck.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

	
	We both agreed that a good wireframe is simple. Also, when navigating different sections of a page, we both kept
	a consistent header to point us back to the home page if needed to be done. We used different tools to do our 
	wireframes and that was fine, we both agreed that any tool is fine. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	I learned about the <section> tag and the <article> tag. These are great when sectioning your page into different
	parts with headers. Aslo, the header tag is a nice place to keep your navigation bar. I also used a <footer> tag 
	in my layout. I feel like those semantic elements are essential to any web page.
