My name is Mohammad Amin, most people call me Mo. I earned my BA in Comp Sci from Hunter College, in NYC where I live. Since then, I have been developing websites professionally. My favorite languages are Ruby and JavaScript. On this site, I share thoughts and ideas as I explore various technologies and libraries.
